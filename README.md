# Energy_Plant_Data_Analytics:

In this case study, we analysed the data associated to an energy plant.
We conducted the following metrics for our analysis:
• The transaction summary for each fuel type.
• A general summary report for the plants.
• An advanced summary report on the customers.

Steps involved:-

  1. In this case study, we constructed the table schema by using four tables.
  
  2. When manipulating the data, we have added primary key when primary key is not clearly defined.
  
  3. In this case, more than one table will have a primary key which is not a foreign key.
  
  4. If we look at the ‘Energy Sales Transaction’ table in the table schema, we will notice that there is no primary key!
  
  5. We used row number SQL window function to create a synthetic primary key.
